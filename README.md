And then run, in another command line:
```bash
python src\csvToJSONConverter.py
```

### Ponit 3
To run the third point, start the REST API by running the following command
```bash
python src\app.py
```
And then run, in another command line:
```bash
python src\backupToAVRO.py
```
At this point, a *GET* of the entire table is performed, to later transform it into an .AVRO file and save it in the /backup folder

To run the last point, start the REST API by running the following command
```bash
python src\app.py
```
And then run, in another command line:
```bash
